<< Binary classification using 'bank marketing data' from UCI machine learning repository >>

  * Visualizations using gglot2
  * Applied 'mice' package for the data imputation
	- all customer data can be imputed in two differen ways
		a. apply the data imputation to whole data set
		b. apply the data imputation to 'new_customer' and 'old_customer' seperately
  * Model candidates: 
	- xgboost
	- lasso
	- ksvm (radial)
	- randomforest
  * Applied random search for tuning parameters
      - 'mlr' and 'parallelMap' packages are used to run parallel processing
  * Compared model candidates with multiple train/test splits (random)
      - used boxplots to visualize performances of each candidate
      - scaled and re-scaled boxplots
